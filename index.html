        <h2>Michael Jordan</h2>
        
        <p>What do you get someone who, with six NBA championships, five most valuable player awards, 14 All-Star selections, 10 scoring titles and multiple millions of dollars, seemingly has it all?</p>
        
        <p>Well, in the case of Michael Jordan's 50th birthday, memories suffice. </p>
        
        <p>The greatest athlete in Chicago's history is a half-century old. The memories he and the Bulls created will last generations. When Jordan entered the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, the Tribune gauged his lasting legacy, traveling the world to report stories of his lingering impact.</p>

        <h4>Memories From NBA Players </h4>
        
        <p> <strong>Dominique Wilkins, Hall of Fame Hawks forward</strong>; One game I scored 50, maybe 57, in Atlanta. I remember going back to Chicago and he scored 60. He took it a little personal. And the way he scored 60 was incredible. We put everybody on him but the kitchen sink but couldn't stop him. Couldn't stop him. Assassin. That's what he was. Probably the most competitive and feared guy I have ever played against.</p>
        
        <p> <strong>Kobe Bryant, All-Star Lakers guard</strong>; Aside from all the stuff he has done on the court, the biggest thing — even beyond his athleticism and flashy game — was how fundamentally sound he was. As a young kid growing up watching that, that's the thing that I saw. I saw his ability to get to the basket to make all these flashy plays.</p>
        
        <p> <strong>LeBron James, All-Star Heat forward</strong>; I've got so many memories of MJ. Name it. From the shoes to him flying through the air and switching hands against the Lakers to him hitting 3s versus the Blazers to him being on the TV screen with Bugs Bunny to him jumping over buildings in the suit in the commercials to him swinging a baseball bat or hitting a golf ball to him having a cartoon. MJ was an inspiration to me. He has done so many great things for our sport, so many great things for sport in general.</p>
        
        <p> <strong>Reggie Miller, Hall of Fame Pacers guard</strong>; The one that stands out — and I mentioned it in my Hall of Fame speech — was the first time I faced him, which was an exhibition. We were in one of those obscure places, a neutral-site game. … I was a rookie. It was Chuck Person's second year. As most veterans do, they go through the motions. I was a jacked-up rookie, going 100 percent. Chuck, where I get all my talking from, was getting me all hyped up, saying, "You're killing Jordan.'' End of the half, I have 10. Jordan has eight. Chuck was telling me to talk mess to Michael. He was saying, ''You're the new guy. You're going to be all that.'' Michael just looked at me. In the second half, the real Michael Jordan came out. I think he ended up with 45 points. I had 12, just two after half. He looked at me and I was like, "OK, now I get it.''</p>
